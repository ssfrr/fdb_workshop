Day 3: Arduino!
===============

Here we introduce the concept of programming as a detailed set of instructions
or a recipe for a computer to follow. We create an oscillator that duplicates
the functionality of Day 2, but in code. We then go on to show how it's much
easier to add features to software than hardware.
