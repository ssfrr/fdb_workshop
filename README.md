Music Technology Workshop
=========================

Spencer Russell, David Fleurimond and Dale Joachim  traveled to
Fond-des-Blancs, Haiti on January 11th, 2014 to present a 4-day pilot workshop
on music science and technology. The workshop was organized on behalf of Haiti
Projects, a non-profit organization with established clinic, artisanal and
library for women in Fond-des-Blancs.

This material expects a certain amount of familiarity on the part of the
teacher with electronics and arduino programming. The intended audience of
these materials is people who are already familiar with these concepts but are
looking for a framework to help teach them to others.

See the subfolders "Day 1", etc. for individual lessons.
